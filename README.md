# State Management Quiz

This week was a group project to introduce global state management. I worked with Klaudia Wr√≥blewska, Isaac Kamran, Manne Johansson and Andrej.

We made a game within a game. So it's tic-tac-toe, but to place a circle you have to win a quiz question. If you answer the quiz question wrong you get a cross. Three circles in a row = you win. Three crosses in a row = you lose.

### The Problem

To brainstorm we used Figma where we gathered ideas and inspirational pictures. We mob programmed most of the time but also made branches for specific features.
